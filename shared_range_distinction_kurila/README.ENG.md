# Shared Range Distinction

The display for the increased range due to buffs/items has been redesigned so that it is easier to see which range is meant.

- The "**Range**" for the range of emergency services (fire/police/doctors) is now called "**Range of Emergency Forces**"
- The "**Range**" for the range of public services (pub/school/etc) and that of the Arctic Heater is now called "**Range of Public Services**"
